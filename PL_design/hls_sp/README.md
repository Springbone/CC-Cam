# This folder contains the files to recover two IP core design in Vivado HLS 2018.3
* **generated_ip**:
	- The zip files are generated by C Synthesis in HLS. Unzip and add their path in Vivado to recover the block design.
	- The indexing registers' address and the state registers' descriptions of the IP cores' interfaces are in:
	`./generated_ip/drivers/FISTA_GRAD_v1_0/src/xfista_grad_hw.h`
* **scripts**:
	- The top module *FISTA_GRAD* is in `main_static.cpp`;
	- `fista_static.h` contains the macro definitions, the custom types' definitions and the function declarations
	- `grad.cpp`: the definitions of sub modules(sub functions)
	- `tb.cpp`: the testbench for C simulation. Please change the path of testing bin file to recover the project.
* **test_binfile**:
	- A picture of flower and its bin file are provided for C Simulation. 
	Other testing bin file can be generated by `GD.ipynb` in the folder `py2hls_test_tools`.
	The simulation results can be compared with the log_files the folder `py2hls_test_tools`.
	- The result.bin derived from simulation can be visualized by Python script. 
	The difference between the simulation results and Python script results is similar to `hls_vs_py_1021.png`.
